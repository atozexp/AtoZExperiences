# AtoZ Experiences


Pitch: Many stay home moms report feeling 'stir crazy' and their social needs are not met. Enter ABC experience (Think AirBNB experiences...but for stay at home moms) . People can host an experience, and earn money leading people on activities they love. It’s an opportunity for anyone to share their hobbies, skills, or expertise. The basic premise is to emulate Airbnb experiences, but instead of targeting tourists traveling to a new area, one targets stay-at-home moms.
 
 For the MVP Create:
 
 1. An on-boarding process for a new general user (user that will consume the service)
 2. On-boarding process for user who wants to generate content (i.e. organize experiences for other local stay-at-home moms)
 3. profile page for users.
 4. Ability to easily create / setup an experience
 5. Ability to easily edit / delete an experience
 6. Ability to easily search / find experience through title, dates, location, and price filters
 7. Home page to see available experiences for general user
 
 Stretch: Allow user to set an availability schedule for each experience, whether that's daily, weekly, or monthly.
